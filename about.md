title: About me 
---

I am in general interested and passionate in developing hardware and software architecture and solutions for various domain-specific 
problems. 

I have been working on different chip projects as founding team member including machine learning accelerators, big data analytics accelerators (in-memory relational database) and DSP processors. 

The fast-changing applications and expected end of Moore's law create so many opportunities for computer architects who have a deep understanding of both software and hardware. It's an exciting era!
